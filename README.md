# Semiconductor-Optoelectronic-Devices
The present reciprocity contains my assignments in the course of [PHYS-675](https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en/courses/110) during my MSc studies at the Physics Dept. of the Univ. of Crete. The assignments consist of analytical and computational calculations in the broad field of Semiconductor and Optoelectronic devices.

In total, there are four (4) files and each one contains: 
  - assignment (problems to be solved)
  - MATLAB scripts
  - final report
    
Please, navigate yourself throught the files and feel free to send any questions you may have at  [dakisfilippos@vt.edu](dakisfilippos@vt.edu).
